## Philosophy
In the fast growing field of software engineering and development and even more rapidly growing sector of game development the future is hard to predict. We are working with this game as our assignment.
In general software project is a project focusing on the creation of software. Consequently, Success can be measured by taking a look at the resulting software.
In a game project, the product is a game.But here comes the point. A game is much more than just its software.It has to provide content to become enjoyable.Just like a web server, without content it is useless and the quality cannot be measured.This has an important effect on game project as a whole.The software part of project is not the only one, and it must be considered in connection to all other parts. 


## Threejs
Threejs is cross browser JavaScript library and Application Programming Interface used to create display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser.
Three.js includes the following features 
*	Effects: Anaglyph, cross-eyed and parallax barrier.
*	Scenes: add and remove objects at run-time; fog
*	Cameras: perspective and orthographic; controllers: trackball, FPS, path and more
*	Animation: armatures, frame, kinematics, morph and key frame 
*	Lights: ambient, direction, point and spot lights; shadows: cast and receive
*	Shaders: access to full OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) capabilities: lens flare, depth pass and extensive post-processing library
*	Objects: meshes, particles, sprites, lines, ribbons, bones and more - all with Level of Detail 
*	Geometry: plane, cube, sphere, torus, 3D text and more; modifiers: lathe, extrude and tube

 ## About Trudo
Trudo is basically a 3D game which sounds like ludo but it actually has different functionalities and feel. As the name suggests it can be played by atmost three players. It has triangular plane in which each player have their house from where they have to start their game. It is a variant of the traditional Ludo game.
### Key features of Trudo:
a.	3 players can play together.
b.	A player can come out of house if dice shows the value ‘1’.
c.	On value ‘6’,no subsequent chance will be provided i.e. each player will have only one chance in all conditions and then it will shift to the next person even if the player rolls 6 or kill any other player.
d.	Place with the house color will be a safe point and for others it will be killed i.e. no one can kill the token if it is in the house color and if token lands on the other house color,player need to start from the beginning.
e.	First player to complete the triangle and back to home will be the winner.
