## Philosophy
In the fast growing field of software engineering and development and even more rapidly growing sector of game development the future is hard to predict. We are working with this game as our assignment.
In general software project is a project focusing on the creation of software. Consequently, Success can be measured by taking a look at the resulting software.
In a game project, the product is a game.But here comes the point. A game is much more than just its software.It has to provide content to become enjoyable.Just like a web server, without content it is useless and the quality cannot be measured.This has an important effect on game project as a whole.The software part of project is not the only one, and it must be considered in connection to all other parts. 


## Threejs

Three.js includes the following features 
*	Effects: Anaglyph, cross-eyed and parallax barrier.
*	Scenes: add and remove objects at run-time; fog
*	Cameras: perspective and orthographic; controllers: trackball, FPS, path and more
*	Animation: armatures, frame, kinematics, morph and key frame 
*	Lights: ambient, direction, point and spot lights; shadows: cast and receive
*	Shaders: access to full OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) capabilities: lens flare, depth pass and extensive post-processing library
*	Objects: meshes, particles, sprites, lines, ribbons, bones and more - all with Level of Detail 
*	Geometry: plane, cube, sphere, torus, 3D text and more; modifiers: lathe, extrude and tube
